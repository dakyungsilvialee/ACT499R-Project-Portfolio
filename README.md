# ACT499R-Project-Portfolio
## Introduction
> Compilation of ACCT499R Projects regarding data cleaning, visualization, and manipulation by Python.


## Technologies Used
>  
* Python


# [Project 1: Python Basics](https://github.com/dakyungsilvialee/ACT499R-Project-Portfolio/blob/master/Python%20Basics.py)
* Write Python if loops through dictionaries and analyze x y z


# [Project 2: GDP Analysis](https://github.com/dakyungsilvialee/ACT499R-Project-Portfolio/blob/master/GDP%20Analysis.py)
* Manipulate integer data types into string/object 
* Analyze which country in a specific year that had the poorest citizens and how they improved by using group by functions
* Calculate total GDP, worldwide gdp per Capita, and average age of billionaires 


# [Project 3: Australian Tax Return Data Analysis](https://github.com/dakyungsilvialee/ACT499R-Project-Portfolio/blob/master/analyzing_australian_tax_return_data_part_i__2022.py) & [part 2](https://github.com/dakyungsilvialee/ACT499R-Project-Portfolio/blob/master/analyzing_australian_tax_return_data_part_ii__2022.py)
* Implement loops in Python to distinguish private and public firms and clean tax return data of 5 datasets per 4k+ rows
* Calculate effective tax rate for various firms by using Python Boolean index to filter out different income year and sought
most profitable firm with 10.57% increase


# [Project 4: New York City Housing Regression Analysis](https://github.com/dakyungsilvialee/ACT499R-Project-Portfolio/blob/master/New%20York%20City%20Housing%20Regression%20Analysis.py)
* Write groupby and describe functions to gain summary statistics of sales price in each borough
* Create boxplot and using the quantile function to show the bottom 95% in the second boxplot
* Analyze different boroughs and their housing price trends by calculating borough price per sqft while filter out outliers
* Utilize smf.ols function to describe 76% variation in sales price from the independent variable
* Run a regression and identify the leading housing factor that determines the trend of the New York real-estate scene


# [Project 5: Forecasting](https://github.com/dakyungsilvialee/ACT499R-Project-Portfolio/blob/master/Forecasting%20Stock.py)
* Explore Coca Cola's stock history of 5 years and create a scatterplot to identify the trend of the business performance
* Use outsampling method to ceate ols regression and effectively predict Coke's stock price in the next 5 years
* Create visuzliation with forecast function and interpret alpha and beta variables in the outsampled regression model
* Calculate and interpret autocorrelation cut off values


# [Project 6: Monte Carlo & Forecasting](https://github.com/dakyungsilvialee/ACT499R-Project-Portfolio/blob/master/Monte%20Carlo%20%26%20Forecasting.py)
* Explore data by using group by and where functions to filter out home depot and its last 4 observations
* Create a model with quarterly seasons in order to efficeintly compare the insights from the insample and outsample model
* Build lineplots and scatterplots to interpret different confidence intervals and how the pandemic effected home depot's business 


# [Project 7: Stock Price Prediction & Trend Analysis](https://github.com/dakyungsilvialee/ACT499R-Project-Portfolio/blob/master/stock%20price%20prediction%20%26%20trend%20analysis.py)
* Analyze x and y by using supervised leraning analysis 
* 


# [Project 8: New York Housing Final Project](https://github.com/dakyungsilvialee/ACT499R-Project-Portfolio/blob/master/Analyzing%20impact%20of%20the%20Pandemic%20in%20NYC%20Residences%20Prices.py)
* Write groupby and describe functions to gain summary statistics of sales price in each borough
* Create boxplot and using the quantile function to show the bottom 95% in the second boxplot
* Analyze different boroughs and their housing price trends by calculating borough price per sqft while filter out outliers
* Utilize smf.ols function to describe 76% variation in sales price from the independent variable
* Run a regression and identify the leading housing factor that determines the trend of the New York real-estate scene
